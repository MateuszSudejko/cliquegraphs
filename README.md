# cliquegraphs
Functions BronKerboschDirected2 and GreedyRandom are implementaions of BronKerbosch and its greedy version.
In the file generateGraphs.m first five lines are to be updated with desired values for testing.
File readgraphfromfile.m reads file graph.txt, displays the graphs from the file and performs BronKerbosch algorithm on them.
User may adjust graph.txt file as desired to test their prepared graphs.
To execute any of the files user needs Matlab environment installed.
